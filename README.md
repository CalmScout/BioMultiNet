Multilayer networks as defined by [Kivelä et
al. (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/2/3/203/2841130)
generalize graphs to capture the rich network data often associated with
complex systems, allowing us to study a broad range of phenomena using a
common representation, using the same multilayer tools and methods.
Formally, a multilayer network M is defined as a quadruple
$M = (V_M, E_M, V, L)$, where the sequence $L = (L_a)_{a=1}^d$ defines
sets $L_a$ of elementary layers, the set $V$ defines the nodes of the
network, the node-layers are
$V_M \subseteq  V \times  L_1 \times  ... \times  L_d$, and the edges
$E_M \subseteq  V_M \times  V_M$ are defined between node-layers. Put
simply, a node-layer is an association of a node $v \in  V$ with a layer
$\in  L \times ...\times  L$ of dimensionality $d$, nodes can exist on
an arbitrary number of layers, and edges can connect node-layers within
layers and across arbitrary pairs of layers, which can differ in an
arbitrary number of dimensions. The dimensions $1, 2, ..., d$ are called
the aspects of the network (e.g., a two-aspect transport network could
have time as its first aspect and transport mode as its second
aspect)(description from
[pymnet](https://mnets.github.io/pymnet/overview.html) package).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Cover code by tests
- [x] Add functionality to generate synthetic networks
- [x] Port implementation of CmmD algorithm from R to Python
- [ ] Profile and optimize code (MNHACK24)
- [ ] Explore alternatives to MolTi clustering
- [ ] Reimplement Louvian clustering in Python, add additional community
  detection algorithms
- [ ] PyG integration

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install BioMultiNet in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure BioMultiNet package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to BioMultiNet
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/CalmScout/BioMultiNet):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/CalmScout/BioMultiNet.git
```

or from [conda](https://anaconda.org/CalmScout/BioMultiNet)

``` sh
$ conda install -c CalmScout BioMultiNet
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/BioMultiNet/)

``` sh
$ pip install BioMultiNet
```

### Documentation

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/CalmScout/BioMultiNet)’s
[pages](https://CalmScout.github.io/BioMultiNet/). Additionally you can
find package manager specific guidelines on
[conda](https://anaconda.org/CalmScout/BioMultiNet) and
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/BioMultiNet/) respectively.
