Multilayer networks as defined by [Kivelä et
al. (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/2/3/203/2841130)
generalize graphs to capture the rich network data often associated with
complex systems, allowing us to study a broad range of phenomena using a
common representation, using the same multilayer tools and methods.
Formally, a multilayer network M is defined as a quadruple
*M* = (*V*<sub>*M*</sub>, *E*<sub>*M*</sub>, *V*, *L*), where the
sequence *L* = (*L*<sub>*a*</sub>)<sub>*a* = 1</sub><sup>*d*</sup>
defines sets *L*<sub>*a*</sub> of elementary layers, the set *V* defines
the nodes of the network, the node-layers are
*V*<sub>*M*</sub> ⊆ *V* × *L*<sub>1</sub> × ... × *L*<sub>*d*</sub>, and
the edges *E*<sub>*M*</sub> ⊆ *V*<sub>*M*</sub> × *V*<sub>*M*</sub> are
defined between node-layers. Put simply, a node-layer is an association
of a node *v* ∈ *V* with a layer  ∈ *L* × ... × *L* of dimensionality
*d*, nodes can exist on an arbitrary number of layers, and edges can
connect node-layers within layers and across arbitrary pairs of layers,
which can differ in an arbitrary number of dimensions. The dimensions
1, 2, ..., *d* are called the aspects of the network (e.g., a two-aspect
transport network could have time as its first aspect and transport mode
as its second aspect)(description from
[pymnet](https://mnets.github.io/pymnet/overview.html) package).

## Roadmap

- ☐ Generate small dataset and cover code by tests
- ☐ Port implementation of CmmD algorithm from R to Python
- ☐ Profile and optimize code (MNHACK24)
- ☐ Explore alternatives to MolTi clustering
- ☐ Reimplement Louvian clustering in Python, add additional community
  detection algorithms
- ☐ PyG integration

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install BioMultiNet in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure BioMultiNet package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to BioMultiNet
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/CalmScout/BioMultiNet):
