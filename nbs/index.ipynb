    "Multilayer networks as defined by [Kivel√§ et al. (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/2/3/203/2841130) generalize graphs to capture the rich network data often associated with complex systems, allowing us to study a broad range of phenomena using a common representation, using the same multilayer tools and methods. Formally, a multilayer network M is defined as a quadruple $M = (V_M, E_M, V, L)$, where the sequence $L = (L_a)_{a=1}^d$ defines sets $L_a$ of elementary layers, the set $V$ defines the nodes of the network, the node-layers are $V_M \\subseteq  V \\times  L_1 \\times  ... \\times  L_d$, and the edges $E_M \\subseteq  V_M \\times  V_M$ are defined between node-layers. Put simply, a node-layer is an association of a node $v \\in  V$ with a layer $\\in  L \\times ...\\times  L$ of dimensionality $d$, nodes can exist on an arbitrary number of layers, and edges can connect node-layers within layers and across arbitrary pairs of layers, which can differ in an arbitrary number of dimensions. The dimensions $1, 2, ..., d$ are called the aspects of the network (e.g., a two-aspect transport network could have time as its first aspect and transport mode as its second aspect)(description from [pymnet](https://mnets.github.io/pymnet/overview.html) package)."
